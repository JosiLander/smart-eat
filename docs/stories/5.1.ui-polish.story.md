## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Stories 1.0-4.2, we have:
- Complete app functionality with all core features
- Settings management system implemented
- Basic UI components and navigation
- Service layer with error handling
- User feedback mechanisms in place

### Critical User Feedback Addressed
- **Font Size Issues**: Current fonts are too large, need smaller, consistent typography
- **Settings Layout**: Settings tab doesn't use full screen width
- **Inconsistent Elements**: Back buttons, headers, and empty states have different sizes
- **Missing Feedback**: No visual feedback for interactions
- **Accessibility**: Poor touch targets and missing accessibility features

### Design System Requirements
- **Typography**: Smaller, consistent font sizes across all components
- **Colors**: Light/dark theme support with proper contrast
- **Spacing**: Systematic spacing scale for consistent layouts
- **Components**: Reusable component library with consistent styling
- **Icons**: Replace emoji icons with proper icon system

### Technical Implementation Strategy
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries for graceful error handling
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading indicators for all async operations
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44pt for all interactive elements
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and optimization for better user experience
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper labels and roles
