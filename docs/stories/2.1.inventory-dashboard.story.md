# Story 2.1: Inventory Dashboard

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to view and manage my food inventory in an organized dashboard,
**so that** I can easily see what food I have and track expiration dates

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard displays all inventory items in a clean, organized layout
2. Items are grouped by categories (fruits, vegetables, packaged goods, etc.)
3. Items show name, quantity, and expiration date clearly
4. Items are sorted by expiration date (soonest first)
5. User can search and filter items by name or category
6. User can edit item details (name, quantity, expiration date)
7. User can delete items from inventory
8. Dashboard shows summary statistics (total items, expiring soon, etc.)
9. Pull-to-refresh functionality updates inventory data
10. Empty state shows helpful message when no items exist

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Stories 1.1-1.3, we have:
- Camera functionality for capturing photos
- AI recognition for identifying grocery items
- OCR date extraction for expiration dates
- User authentication and preferences system

### Data Models
Based on the database architecture, this story will need:
- Inventory_items table: id, user_id, name, category, quantity, expiration_date, created_at
- Item_categories table: id, name, color, icon
- User_inventory table: user_id, item_id, quantity, added_date

### API Specifications
Based on the services architecture, this story will need:
- Inventory Service endpoints: GET /inventory, PUT /inventory/:id, DELETE /inventory/:id
- Search endpoints: GET /inventory/search?q=term
- Filter endpoints: GET /inventory?category=fruits&expiring_soon=true
- Sync endpoints: POST /inventory/sync

### Component Specifications
Based on the system overview:
- Clean, intuitive dashboard design
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Integration with inventory management system
- Real-time data updates and synchronization

### File Locations
Based on the project structure:
- Dashboard components in smart-eat-app/components/dashboard/
- Inventory management in smart-eat-app/services/inventory/
- Data models in smart-eat-app/models/
- Utilities in smart-eat-app/utils/

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for inventory data management
- Integration tests for dashboard functionality
- UI tests for search and filtering
- Performance tests for large inventory lists
- Offline functionality tests

### Technical Constraints
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
- Offline data storage and synchronization
- Performance with large inventory lists
- Real-time data updates
- Search and filter performance

### Testing
- Test dashboard with various inventory sizes
- Test search and filtering functionality
- Test item editing and deletion
- Test offline functionality
- Test data synchronization
- Test performance with 100+ items
