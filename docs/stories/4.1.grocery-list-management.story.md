## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Stories 1.1-1.3, 2.1-2.2, and 3.1, we have:
- Camera functionality for capturing photos
- AI recognition for identifying grocery items
- OCR date extraction for expiration dates
- Inventory dashboard for viewing items
- Expiration notifications system
- Recipe database and matching system
- User authentication and preferences

### Data Models
Based on the database architecture, this story will need:
- Grocery_lists table: id, user_id, name, status, created_at, updated_at
- Grocery_items table: list_id, item_name, quantity, notes, checked, price_estimate
- List_shares table: list_id, shared_with_user_id, permissions, created_at
- Shopping_history table: user_id, list_id, completed_at, total_cost

### API Specifications
Based on the services architecture, this story will need:
- Grocery List Service endpoints: GET /lists, POST /lists, PUT /lists/:id, DELETE /lists/:id
- Item endpoints: POST /lists/:id/items, PUT /lists/:id/items/:item_id
- Share endpoints: POST /lists/:id/share, DELETE /lists/:id/share/:user_id
- Recipe integration: POST /recipes/:id/add-to-list

### Component Specifications
Based on the system overview:
- Clean grocery list interface with check-off functionality
- Integration with recipe system for missing ingredients
- Sharing capabilities for collaborative shopping
- Smart suggestions and cost estimation

### File Locations
