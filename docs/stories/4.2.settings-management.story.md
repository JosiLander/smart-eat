- Settings_defaults table: setting_key, default_value, data_type, validation_rules
- Settings_history table: user_id, setting_key, old_value, new_value, changed_at
- Notification_preferences table: user_id, notification_type, enabled, frequency, timing
- App_preferences table: user_id, camera_quality, sync_frequency, language, region

### Enhanced API Specifications
Based on the services architecture, this story will need:
- Settings Service endpoints: GET /settings, PUT /settings/:category, POST /settings/reset
