# Story 2.2: Expiration Notifications

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to receive notifications about food items expiring soon,
**so that** I can use them before they go bad and reduce waste

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System automatically detects items expiring within 3 days
2. Push notifications are sent for expiring items
3. User can configure notification preferences (timing, frequency)
4. Notifications show item name, expiration date, and suggested actions
5. User can dismiss or snooze notifications
6. Notification history is accessible in the app
7. Notifications work when app is closed (background processing)
8. User can enable/disable notifications completely
9. Multiple expiring items are grouped in single notification
10. Notifications include recipe suggestions for expiring items

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Stories 1.1-1.3 and 2.1, we have:
- Camera functionality for capturing photos
- AI recognition for identifying grocery items
- OCR date extraction for expiration dates
- Inventory dashboard for viewing items
- User authentication and preferences system

### Data Models
Based on the database architecture, this story will need:
- Notifications table: id, user_id, item_id, message, type, sent_at, read_at
- Notification_settings table: user_id, enabled, timing, frequency, created_at
- Expiration_alerts table: item_id, alert_date, notification_sent, created_at

### API Specifications
Based on the services architecture, this story will need:
- Notification Service endpoints: POST /notifications/send, GET /notifications/history
- Settings endpoints: GET /notifications/settings, PUT /notifications/settings
- Background processing endpoints: POST /notifications/check-expiring
- Recipe suggestion endpoints: GET /recipes/suggestions?item_id=123

### Component Specifications
Based on the system overview:
- Background notification processing
- Push notification integration
- Notification management interface
- Integration with inventory and recipe systems

### File Locations
Based on the project structure:
- Notification components in smart-eat-app/components/notifications/
- Background services in smart-eat-app/services/background/
- Notification utilities in smart-eat-app/utils/notifications/
- Settings screens in smart-eat-app/screens/settings/

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for expiration detection logic
- Integration tests for notification sending
- UI tests for notification management
- Background processing tests
- Cross-platform notification testing

### Technical Constraints
- Cross-platform push notification compatibility
- Background processing limitations on mobile
- Notification permission requirements
- Battery optimization considerations
- Data privacy for notification content

### Testing
- Test notification sending on both iOS and Android
- Test background processing and scheduling
- Test notification preferences and settings
- Test notification dismissal and snooze
- Test notification history and management
- Test performance with many expiring items
