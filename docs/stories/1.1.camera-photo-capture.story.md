## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project, so no previous story context available.

### Data Models
Based on the database architecture [Source: docs/architecture/database.md], this story will need to prepare for:
- Food items table structure for future inventory storage
- User authentication for personal inventory management
- Image storage considerations for captured photos

### API Specifications
Based on the services architecture [Source: docs/architecture/services.md], this story will need to prepare for:
- User Service endpoints for authentication
- Inventory Service endpoints for future item storage
- Image upload endpoints for photo processing

### Component Specifications
Based on the system overview [Source: docs/architecture/system-overview.md]:
- Cross-platform mobile app (Flutter or React Native)
- Clean, intuitive camera interface
- Integration with AI/ML services for future object recognition

### File Locations
Based on the project structure:
- Mobile app source code in root directory
- Camera components in appropriate UI folder
- Image storage in local device storage initially
- Configuration files for camera permissions

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for camera functionality
- Integration tests for photo capture flow
- UI tests for camera screen interactions
- Permission handling tests

### Technical Constraints
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
- Camera permission requirements
- Local storage limitations
- Image format and size considerations
- Performance requirements for real-time camera preview

### Testing
- Test camera permissions on both iOS and Android
- Test photo capture functionality
- Test image storage and retrieval
- Test UI interactions and navigation
- Test error handling for camera failures
