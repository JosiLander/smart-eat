# Story 1.0: Project Setup & Authentication

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to create an account and log into the Smart-Eat app,
**so that** I can have my own personalized food inventory and preferences

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can register with email and password
2. User can log in with existing credentials
3. User can set and save dietary preferences during registration
4. User session persists across app restarts
5. User can log out and clear session data
6. Password reset functionality works via email
7. Input validation prevents invalid registrations
8. Error messages are clear and helpful

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the foundational story that all other stories depend on.

### Data Models
Based on the database architecture, this story will need:
- Users table: id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at
- User_preferences table: user_id, dietary_restrictions, allergies, created_at
- Auth_tokens table: user_id, token, expires_at, created_at

### API Specifications
Based on the services architecture, this story will need:
- User Service endpoints: POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login, POST /auth/logout
- Password reset endpoints: POST /auth/forgot-password, POST /auth/reset-password
- User profile endpoints: GET /user/profile, PUT /user/preferences

### Component Specifications
Based on the system overview:
- Cross-platform mobile app (React Native or Flutter)
- Clean authentication UI with modern design
- Secure token storage and session management
- Integration with user service for profile management

### File Locations
Based on the project structure:
- Authentication components in smart-eat-app/components/auth/
- API services in smart-eat-app/services/
- Database models in smart-eat-app/models/
- Configuration files in smart-eat-app/config/

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for authentication logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- UI tests for registration and login flows
- Security tests for token storage
- Performance tests for authentication speed

### Technical Constraints
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
- Secure password hashing and storage
- Token-based authentication with expiration
- Offline capability for basic app functionality
- GDPR compliance for user data

### Testing
- Test registration with valid and invalid data
- Test login with correct and incorrect credentials
- Test password reset functionality
- Test session persistence across app restarts
- Test dietary preferences saving and retrieval
- Test error handling and user feedback
