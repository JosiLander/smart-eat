# Story 3.1: Recipe Database & Matching

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to find recipes that use ingredients I have in my inventory,
**so that** I can cook meals and reduce food waste

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Recipe database contains at least 200 recipes with ingredients and instructions
2. Recipe search finds matches based on available inventory items
3. Recipes can be filtered by dietary preferences (vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)
4. Recipe results show ingredient matches and missing items
5. User can view recipe details (ingredients, instructions, cooking time)
6. Recipes prioritize items expiring soonest
7. Recipe search returns results in under 2 seconds
8. User can save favorite recipes for quick access
9. Recipe suggestions include nutritional information
10. Search supports partial ingredient name matching

  - [ ] Design recipe data model and schema
  - [ ] Populate database with 200+ recipes
  - [ ] Add nutritional information to recipes
  - [ ] Implement recipe categorization system
- [ ] Task 2: Implement recipe search algorithm (AC: 2, 6, 7, 10)
  - [ ] Create ingredient matching logic
  - [ ] Implement expiration date prioritization
  - [ ] Add partial name matching for ingredients
  - [ ] Optimize search performance for speed
- [ ] Task 3: Build recipe filtering system (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Implement dietary preference filtering
  - [ ] Add cooking time and difficulty filters
  - [ ] Create cuisine type filtering
  - [ ] Add ingredient-based filtering
- [ ] Task 4: Create recipe display components (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Build recipe list component with search results
  - [ ] Create detailed recipe view screen
  - [ ] Add ingredient match/missing indicators
  - [ ] Implement recipe instructions display
- [ ] Task 5: Add recipe management features (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Create favorite recipes functionality
  - [ ] Add recipe rating and review system
  - [ ] Implement recipe sharing capabilities
  - [ ] Add recipe history tracking

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Stories 1.1-1.3 and 2.1-2.2, we have:
- Camera functionality for capturing photos
- AI recognition for identifying grocery items
- OCR date extraction for expiration dates
- Inventory dashboard for viewing items
- Expiration notifications system
- User authentication and dietary preferences

### Data Models
Based on the database architecture, this story will need:
- Recipes table: id, name, description, instructions, cooking_time, difficulty, cuisine_type
- Recipe_ingredients table: recipe_id, ingredient_name, quantity, unit
- Recipe_categories table: id, name, description
- User_favorites table: user_id, recipe_id, created_at
- Recipe_nutrition table: recipe_id, calories, protein, carbs, fat

### API Specifications
Based on the services architecture, this story will need:
- Recipe Service endpoints: GET /recipes, GET /recipes/:id, GET /recipes/search
- Search endpoints: GET /recipes/search?ingredients=apple,banana&diet=vegetarian
- Filter endpoints: GET /recipes?cuisine=italian&max_time=30&difficulty=easy
- Favorite endpoints: POST /recipes/:id/favorite, DELETE /recipes/:id/favorite

### Component Specifications
Based on the system overview:
- Fast recipe search and filtering
- Clean recipe display with ingredient matching
- Integration with inventory and user preferences
- Responsive design for recipe browsing

### File Locations
Based on the project structure:
- Recipe components in smart-eat-app/components/recipes/
- Recipe services in smart-eat-app/services/recipes/
- Recipe data in smart-eat-app/data/recipes/
- Search utilities in smart-eat-app/utils/search/

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for recipe search algorithm
- Integration tests for recipe database
- UI tests for recipe browsing and filtering
- Performance tests for search speed
- Recipe data validation tests

### Technical Constraints
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
- Fast search performance (under 2 seconds)
- Large recipe database management
- Integration with inventory system
- Dietary preference filtering accuracy

### Testing
- Test recipe search with various ingredient combinations
- Test filtering by dietary preferences
- Test recipe display and navigation
- Test favorite recipe functionality
- Test search performance with large database
- Test ingredient matching accuracy
