# Story 4.2: Smart Suggestions & Automation

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the app to intelligently suggest items and automate routine tasks,
**so that** I can save time and never run out of essential items

## Acceptance Criteria
1. App detects low-stock items and suggests adding them to grocery list
2. App suggests recipes based on items expiring soonest
3. App learns user shopping patterns and suggests frequently bought items
4. App automatically adds staple items when running low
5. App provides smart meal planning suggestions
6. App suggests optimal shopping times based on inventory
7. App tracks and learns from user preferences and habits
8. App provides personalized recommendations
9. App can predict when items will run out based on usage patterns
10. App suggests budget-friendly alternatives for expensive items

- [ ] Task 2: Build smart recipe suggestions (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Implement expiration-based recipe prioritization
  - [ ] Create meal planning suggestion algorithm
  - [ ] Add dietary preference consideration
  - [ ] Implement recipe difficulty matching
- [ ] Task 3: Develop learning system (AC: 3, 7, 8)
  - [ ] Create user behavior tracking system
  - [ ] Implement shopping pattern analysis
  - [ ] Add preference learning algorithms
  - [ ] Create personalized recommendation engine
- [ ] Task 4: Add automation features (AC: 4, 6)
  - [ ] Implement automatic grocery list generation
  - [ ] Create smart shopping timing suggestions
  - [ ] Add bulk operations for routine items
  - [ ] Implement automated inventory management
- [ ] Task 5: Build smart features UI (AC: 1, 2, 5, 10)
  - [ ] Create smart suggestions dashboard
  - [ ] Add recommendation cards and actions
  - [ ] Implement smart list generation interface
  - [ ] Add budget optimization suggestions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Stories 1.1-1.3, 2.1-2.2, 3.1, and 4.1, we have:
- Camera functionality for capturing photos
- AI recognition for identifying grocery items
- OCR date extraction for expiration dates
- Inventory dashboard for viewing items
- Expiration notifications system
- Recipe database and matching system
- Grocery list management system
- User authentication and preferences

### Data Models
Based on the database architecture, this story will need:
- User_behavior table: user_id, action_type, item_id, timestamp, context
- Shopping_patterns table: user_id, item_id, frequency, last_purchased, quantity
- Smart_suggestions table: user_id, suggestion_type, item_id, confidence, created_at
- Usage_analytics table: item_id, user_id, usage_frequency, consumption_rate

### API Specifications
Based on the services architecture, this story will need:
- Smart Suggestions Service: GET /suggestions, POST /suggestions/learn
- Learning endpoints: POST /analytics/track, GET /analytics/patterns
- Automation endpoints: POST /automation/generate-list, POST /automation/suggest-recipes
- Prediction endpoints: GET /predictions/stock-out, GET /predictions/shopping-timing

### Component Specifications
Based on the system overview:
- Machine learning integration for pattern recognition
- Smart suggestion dashboard with actionable recommendations
- Automated list generation and management
- Personalized user experience with learning capabilities

### File Locations
Based on the project structure:
- Smart features in smart-eat-app/components/smart/
- Learning algorithms in smart-eat-app/services/learning/
- Analytics tracking in smart-eat-app/services/analytics/
- Prediction models in smart-eat-app/models/predictions/

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for learning algorithms
- Integration tests for smart suggestions
- UI tests for recommendation interface
- Performance tests for prediction accuracy
- Machine learning model validation

### Technical Constraints
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
- Machine learning model performance on mobile
- Privacy considerations for user behavior tracking
- Real-time suggestion generation
- Battery optimization for background learning

### Testing
- Test smart suggestion accuracy and relevance
- Test learning system with various user behaviors
- Test automation features and reliability
- Test prediction accuracy for stock-out alerts
- Test performance with large datasets
- Test privacy and data security
