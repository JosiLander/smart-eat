# Story 1.3: OCR Date Extraction

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the app to automatically read expiration dates from product labels,
**so that** I can track food freshness without manual date entry

## Acceptance Criteria
1. OCR service processes captured photos to extract date text
2. Extracted dates are parsed and validated for common formats
3. User can manually edit incorrect date extractions
4. Date extraction works for various product label formats
5. Extracted dates are formatted consistently (YYYY-MM-DD)
6. Invalid dates are flagged and require manual correction
7. OCR processing shows loading state and progress
8. Fallback to manual date entry when OCR fails

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Set up OCR service integration (AC: 1, 2, 5)
  - [ ] Research and select OCR service (Google Vision, AWS Textract, or custom)
  - [ ] Create OCR service client/API wrapper
  - [ ] Implement image preprocessing for OCR optimization
  - [ ] Set up error handling for OCR service failures
- [ ] Task 2: Implement date extraction logic (AC: 2, 5, 6)
  - [ ] Create date parsing utilities for common formats
  - [ ] Implement date validation and formatting
  - [ ] Add support for various date formats (MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, etc.)
  - [ ] Handle edge cases (no date found, invalid dates)
- [ ] Task 3: Build date editing interface (AC: 3, 6, 8)
  - [ ] Create date editing component with calendar picker
  - [ ] Add manual date entry fallback
  - [ ] Implement date validation and error display
  - [ ] Add "Use Extracted Date" and "Enter Manually" options
- [ ] Task 4: Integrate with recognition flow (AC: 1, 4, 7)
  - [ ] Connect OCR processing to image recognition pipeline
  - [ ] Add loading states and progress indicators
  - [ ] Implement batch processing for multiple items
  - [ ] Add OCR confidence scoring and display
- [ ] Task 5: Add date management features (AC: 2, 5, 6)
  - [ ] Create date storage and retrieval system
  - [ ] Implement date sorting and filtering
  - [ ] Add expiration date calculations
  - [ ] Create date-based inventory alerts

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Stories 1.1 (Camera Photo Capture) and 1.2 (AI Image Recognition), we have:
- Camera functionality implemented with photo capture
- AI recognition system for identifying grocery items
- Image storage and processing pipeline established
- User interface for reviewing recognition results

### Data Models
Based on the database architecture, this story will need:
- Food items table with expiration_date field
- OCR processing history table for analytics
- Date extraction confidence scores storage
- User manual corrections tracking

### API Specifications
Based on the services architecture, this story will need:
- OCR Service integration for text extraction
- Inventory Service endpoints for date storage
- Image processing service for OCR optimization
- Date validation and formatting utilities

### Component Specifications
Based on the system overview:
- OCR service integration layer
- Date editing and validation components
- Integration with inventory management system
- Progress indicators and loading states

### File Locations
Based on the project structure:
- OCR service integration in smart-eat-app/services/ocr/
- Date utilities in smart-eat-app/utils/date/
- Date editing components in smart-eat-app/components/date/
- OCR processing in smart-eat-app/services/processing/

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for OCR service integration
- Integration tests for date extraction flow
- UI tests for date editing interface
- Mock OCR service for development and testing
- Performance testing for OCR processing

### Technical Constraints
- OCR service API rate limits and costs
- Image quality requirements for accurate extraction
- Cross-platform date format compatibility
- Data privacy for image text processing
- Offline fallback for OCR service failures

### Testing
- Test OCR extraction with various image qualities
- Test date parsing with different formats
- Test manual date entry and validation
- Test error handling for OCR failures
- Test performance with large images
- Test date formatting consistency
