# Smart-Eat App - Product Vision

## Project Name
**Smart-Eat** (or alternative ideas to be explored later)

## Problem Statement
In households around the world, food is often wasted due to a lack of awareness of what's available and when it will expire. Users also face the daily challenge of meal planning, especially when trying to use up all the food they have on hand. Smart-Eat aims to solve these problems by providing an intelligent, comprehensive solution for food inventory management and recipe generation.

## Target Audience
The primary target audience is "every person," which we can define more specifically as individuals, couples, and families who want to reduce food waste, save money on groceries, and simplify meal planning. This app is for anyone who has struggled with finding a meal to cook based on what's already in their fridge or pantry.

## Core Value Proposition
Smart-Eat empowers users to reduce food waste and simplify meal planning by intelligently managing their household food inventory through AI-powered scanning and intelligent recipe suggestions.
