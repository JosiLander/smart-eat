# Smart-Eat App - Key Features

## Core Features

### 1. AI-powered Image Recognition
Users can take a photo of their groceries, and the AI will automatically identify products and "best before" dates.

### 2. Intelligent Best-Before Date Management
For products without a printed date (e.g., fresh produce), the AI will provide best-practice storage instructions and generate a recommended "best-before" date.

### 3. Real-time Inventory List
A comprehensive list of all food products currently available in the household, easily viewable and updatable.

### 4. Personalized Recipe Generation
The app will suggest recipes that use the available food items, prioritizing those with the earliest "best before" dates to minimize waste.

### 5. Customizable Dietary Preferences
The ability for users to set dietary restrictions and preferences (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian) that the recipe generator will adhere to.
