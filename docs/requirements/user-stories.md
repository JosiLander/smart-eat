# Smart-Eat App - User Stories

## Primary User Stories

### Core Functionality
* As a busy person, I want to quickly add my groceries to the app by taking a photo so I don't have to spend a lot of time on manual entry.
* As a conscious cook, I want the app to automatically read the "best before" dates from my photos so I can easily track my food's freshness.
* As a user, I want the app to provide clear storage instructions and a "best before" date for fresh produce so I can reduce waste from forgotten items.
* As a user, I want a comprehensive list of all the food in my home so I can know what I have before I go grocery shopping.

### Recipe and Meal Planning
* As a person with dietary preferences, I want to filter recipe suggestions by lifestyles (e.g., gluten-free, vegan) so I can find meals that fit my needs.
* As a person trying to avoid waste, I want recipe suggestions that use the food items I have that are closest to their expiration date so nothing goes to waste.

### Grocery Management
* As a user, I want the app to proactively add commonly used items that are running low to a grocery list so I never run out of staples.
* As a user, I want the app to create a grocery list of missing ingredients for a specific recipe so I can plan my meals for the week easily.

## Acceptance Criteria
Each user story should be testable and measurable, with clear success criteria defined during sprint planning.
