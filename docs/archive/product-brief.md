### **PROJECT BRIEF: Smart-Eat App**

**1. Project Name**
* **Smart-Eat** (or alternative ideas to be explored later)

**2. Problem Statement**
* In households around the world, food is often wasted due to a lack of awareness of what's available and when it will expire. Users also face the daily challenge of meal planning, especially when trying to use up all the food they have on hand. Smart-Eat aims to solve these problems by providing an intelligent, comprehensive solution for food inventory management and recipe generation.

**3. Target Audience**
* The primary target audience is "every person," which we can define more specifically as individuals, couples, and families who want to reduce food waste, save money on groceries, and simplify meal planning. This app is for anyone who has struggled with finding a meal to cook based on what's already in their fridge or pantry.

**4. Key Features (Initial List)**
* **AI-powered Image Recognition:** Users can take a photo of their groceries, and the AI will automatically identify products and "best before" dates.
* **Intelligent Best-Before Date Management:** For products without a printed date (e.g., fresh produce), the AI will provide best-practice storage instructions and generate a recommended "best-before" date.
* **Real-time Inventory List:** A comprehensive list of all food products currently available in the household, easily viewable and updatable.
* **Personalized Recipe Generation:** The app will suggest recipes that use the available food items, prioritizing those with the earliest "best before" dates to minimize waste.
* **Customizable Dietary Preferences:** The ability for users to set dietary restrictions and preferences (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian) that the recipe generator will adhere to.
