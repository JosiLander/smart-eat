### **SPRINT 1 PLAN & MVP SCOPE**

**Goal:** To deliver a functional MVP that allows users to scan groceries, manage a basic inventory, and receive simple recipe suggestions.

**Sprint Backlog:**
* As a user, I can take a photo of my groceries.
* As a user, the app automatically recognizes products from the photo.
* As a user, the app automatically reads the "best before" dates from the photo.
* As a user, I can manually edit or confirm the identified items and dates.
* As a user, the app provides a suggested "best before" date for fresh produce.
* As a user, I can view a list of recipes that can be made with my available ingredients.
* As a user, the app prioritizes recipes that use ingredients with the earliest expiration dates.
* As a user, I can view and manage a simple grocery list.

**Technical Tasks for the Sprint:**
* **Front-End:** Set up the project, create the UI for the dashboard, camera, and lists, and implement camera functionality.
* **Back-End:** Set up the API, implement endpoints, and create a basic database schema.
* **AI/ML:** Create mock services to simulate AI functionality.

**Definition of "Done" for the MVP:**
A deployable app where a user can scan groceries, see them in a list with dates, get basic recipe suggestions, and manage a simple grocery list.
