# Smart-Eat App - System Architecture Overview

## Architecture Philosophy
The Smart-Eat system will be a multi-tiered architecture with a clear separation between the user interface, the application logic, and the data services.

## High-Level Architecture

### Front-End (Mobile & Web)
* **Platform:** A cross-platform framework like Flutter or React Native to deploy a single codebase to both iOS and Android. A web UI will be considered in a later phase.
* **User Interface:** A clean, intuitive design with a dashboard, inventory view, recipe generator, and grocery list.

### Back-End (Server & APIs)
* **Microservices Justification:** Chosen for scalability (especially for AI/ML services), specialization (allowing independent team work), and resilience (one service failure does not affect the entire app).
* **Key Services:** User Service, Inventory Service, Recipe Service, Grocery List Service, Notification Service.

### Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) Services
* **AI/ML Models:** Object Recognition Model, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Model, Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model.

### Database
* **Primary Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for user data, inventory, and recipes.
* **AI/ML Data Store:** A separate, specialized database for large datasets.

## Technology Stack Considerations
- **Cross-platform mobile development** for maximum reach
- **Microservices architecture** for scalability and team independence
- **AI/ML integration** for core functionality
- **Cloud-native deployment** for reliability and scaling
