# Smart-Eat App - AI/ML Architecture

## AI/ML Services Overview
Smart-Eat's core functionality relies on three primary AI/ML models working together to provide intelligent food management.

## Core AI/ML Models

### Object Recognition Model
**Purpose:** Identify food items from photos

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Model Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Training Data:** Food product images with labels
- **Input:** RGB images from mobile camera
- **Output:** Product identification with confidence scores
- **Performance Target:** >90% accuracy for common items

**Features:**
- Multi-item detection in single image
- Product categorization (fruits, vegetables, packaged goods)
- Brand recognition for packaged items
- Confidence scoring for manual review

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Model
**Purpose:** Extract expiration dates from product labels

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Model Type:** Transformer-based OCR (e.g., EasyOCR, PaddleOCR)
- **Training Data:** Product labels with date annotations
- **Input:** Text regions from product images
- **Output:** Extracted date strings with confidence
- **Performance Target:** >95% accuracy for date extraction

**Features:**
- Date format recognition (various formats)
- Text region detection
- Date validation and parsing
- Multiple date format support

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model
**Purpose:** Recipe recommendation and ingredient matching

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Model Type:** Transformer-based language model
- **Training Data:** Recipe databases with ingredient lists
- **Input:** User inventory and preferences
- **Output:** Recipe recommendations with relevance scores
- **Performance Target:** High relevance in recommendations

**Features:**
- Ingredient substitution suggestions
- Dietary preference filtering
- Recipe difficulty assessment
- Cooking time estimation

## Model Integration

### Data Pipeline
1. **Image Capture** → Object Recognition
2. **Text Extraction** → OCR Processing
3. **Data Validation** → Manual Review Interface
4. **Recipe Matching** → NLP Recommendation Engine

### Model Deployment
- **Containerized models** for scalability
- **A/B testing** for model improvements
- **Real-time inference** with caching
- **Model versioning** and rollback capabilities

## Training and Maintenance

### Data Collection
- **User feedback** for model improvement
- **Manual corrections** as training data
- **Performance monitoring** and alerting
- **Regular retraining** schedules

### Model Updates
- **Incremental learning** from user interactions
- **Performance tracking** and metrics
- **Gradual rollout** of new models
- **Fallback mechanisms** for model failures
